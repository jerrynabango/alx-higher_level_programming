# Class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share similar attributes and behaviors. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class type. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class.

# Classes allow you to define reusable code and create multiple objects that share common characteristics and behaviors. You can create and manipulate objects of the class, accessing their attributes and invoking their methods as needed.
