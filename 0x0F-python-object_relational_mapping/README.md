# ORM -> Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique used in software development to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and relational databases. ORM tools and frameworks provide a way to interact with a database using object-oriented code and concepts, making it easier for developers to work with databases in their applications.

# SQLAlchemy - Python library and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that provides a set of high-level API for interacting with relational databases. SQLAlchemy aims to simplify database operations and allow developers to work with databases in a more Pythonic and object-oriented way. It's widely used in web applications, data-driven applications, and other projects where database interactions are necessary.

# sqlite - It's a lightweight, and self-contained relational database management system (RDBMS) that is embedded within applications rather than running as a standalone server. It's often used for small to medium-sized projects and mobile applications due to its simplicity and portability.

# Python virtual environment, often referred to as a "virtualenv," is a self-contained directory that houses a Python interpreter along with its own set of libraries and packages. Virtual environments are used to isolate Python environments and dependencies for different projects, preventing conflicts between packages and versions.

# Creating a Virtual Environment
* pip install virtualenv

# You can check if virtualenv is already installed by running:
* virtualenv --version

# Activate the Virtual Environment:

- On Windows:
* myenv\Scripts\activate

- On macOS and Linux:

* source myenv/bin/activate
